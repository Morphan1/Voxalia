See the [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) file for details on posting issues.

For pull requests:
- You MUST: own the code you submit OR it is MIT or compatible licensed.
- Any and all code you submit is subject to the mini-license below.
- In general, you should confirm your PR is functional in any ways that it may vary.
	- EG if your code adds a system call, it should be tested across multiple operating systems.
	- Or, if your code adds 3 new item types, all 3 item types should be tested with all relevant item activation methods (EG clicking, etc).
- USUALLY, your pull request should fix an open issue.
	- If there is no issue for it, please open one.
	- If issues for it have been closed with a refusal statement, ensure you want to be making a PR at all before bothering with it. Generally, refused issues means PRs are also refused.
		- The exception to this is when an issue is only partially related to what you're doing, or the issue was refused on grounds irrelevantized by your adaptation of it.
			- In these cases, please open a new issue.
